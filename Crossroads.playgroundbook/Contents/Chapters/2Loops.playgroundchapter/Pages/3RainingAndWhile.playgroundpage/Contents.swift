 ## **Let's play!**
 
 Now Peter is ready to play outside. Let's go!!
 
 **Oh no! It's raining.ðŸŒ¨**
 \
 If you click `Run My Code` you can see that it's not a good weather to go outside now. But do you know what happen when you play outside while it's raining?
 
 Probably Peter doesn't know that yet but you can tell him. Do you know what is a `while loop`? It's a structure like the `for` that executes some action while some condition is achieved.
 
 In our case, we have something like this:
 
 `while isRaining() {`
 
 `myFunction()`
 
 `}`
 
 
But what does that means? The actions inside the `while` will be executed while the condition `isRaining()` is true.
 
Now it's in your hands: you have to use the `while loop` to tell what Peter should do while it's raining.
