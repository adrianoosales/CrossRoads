 ## **Hello little friend 👋**
 
 This is Peter and he is 6 years old. He is learning new things everyday. Peter's parents are really good and they try to teach him new things as much as possible.
 
 Yeah, I know, your parents do exactly the same with you, right?
 
 **Wait! 🖐 I got an idea 💡**
 
 I'm sure you're a smart kid so would you like to help Peter to learn new things? Are you with me in this mission?
 
 First of all, to help Peter we will use functions. When you call a function you have to write the name of the function and after insert `'('` and `')'`. Basically a function is an action and this is the way we say to that action to be executed.
 
 Peter is sleeping right now 💤 but I'm sure he is really excited to start learning!
 
 Let's try to execute our first function.
 
 **Hint:** write `peekPeter()` and tap `Run my code` to peek Peter while he is still sleeping. 🤫
