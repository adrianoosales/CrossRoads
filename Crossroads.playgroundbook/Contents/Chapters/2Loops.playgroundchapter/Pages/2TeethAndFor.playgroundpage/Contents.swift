 ## **Getting ready**
 
 Okay, now Peter is awake. Awesome! But what is the first thing you should do when you wake up? Did your parents tell you? 🤔
 
 Yeah! We should brush our teeth. 😁
 
 To brush our teeth we have to repeat the same action for a number of times, right? This is exactly what a iterator loop does. Here we will use the `for` iterator. To use a `for` we just need to say how many times we want to execute some action and that action (inside the iterator) will be executed that number of times. Easy, right? 😉
 
 Let's try to use the `for` to help Peter to brush his teeth?
 
 You should choose the number of repetitions, choose an action to put inside the for and then tap `Run My Code`.

 **Hint**: Be careful because if Peter doesn't brush his teeth enough he'll have unhealthy and yellow teeth. Then choose a good number of brushes. 💦
