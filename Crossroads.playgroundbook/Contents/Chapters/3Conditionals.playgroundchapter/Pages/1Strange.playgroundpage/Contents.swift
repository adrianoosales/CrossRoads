 ## **Always pay attention**
 
 Now that Peter is playing outside in a park next to his house we should remind that it's really important to pay attention all the time, right? But what is the most important thing we should do when we are playing outside without our parents? We can not talk to unknown people, because we don't know who they are, right?
 
 Oh! There is a unknown person coming to talk to Peter. To help Peter this time we will use a conditional statement called `if-else`.
 The `if-else` is really easy. Basically, if something is true you should execute that action. Easy peasy, right? üçã
 
 In our case we have an if and you should complete the action inside this if to help Peter learn this important lesson. Can you do this? üëç
 
 So, if someone is a unknown person, what we have to do?
