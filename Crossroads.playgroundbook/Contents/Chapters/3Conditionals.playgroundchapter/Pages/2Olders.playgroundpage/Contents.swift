 ## **Respecting the olders**
 
 This is a really important day! Peter learned many valuable lessons thanks to you. Thank you little friend, you are the best!ðŸ¤©
 
 What if we help Peter in just one more challenge?
 
 Here comes Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. They are a really nice elder couple that are friends with Peter's parents and Peter knows them well. They are not strangers for Peter so far.
 
 You can click in `Run My Code` and see that they are next to Peter now.
 
 Well, I'm sure your parents teach you that we should be respectful and nice with people older than you, right? Let's use the `if-else` conditional again (we've just learned about it ðŸ˜„) to help Peter understand this important lesson, what do you think?
 
 So, if someone is not a strange and older than us, how should we treat them?
