# CrossRoads
WWDC 18 Scholarship Submission by Adriano Sales.

The WWDC 18 Scholarship Contest was aimed to create a PlaygroundBook. 

CrossRoads is a PlaygroundBook developed to introduce kids to the common structues in programming languages. Concepts like functions, if-else, for and while are explained in a interactive and fun way. 

Our main character, Peter, is a clever boy and his parents are all the time trying to teach him important things. Things like brush your teeth, respect people older than you and don't talk to strangers are some of the teaching the kids will learn while they try to help Peter to take some decisions. 
For example, in one of the chapters we present to the kids a scene and it's raining outside. They should choose an action to Peter using the while structure. In this case, it's presented something like:  while it's raining, what Peter should do? 
If they choose go outside anyway, Peter will be sick and he'll have to stay at home for a long time. Otherwise, if they choose wait for the rain stops then we show that after the rain Peter is good to go outside and play all day long. This way we try to help the kids to learn important lessons and at the same time we introduce them to important programming language concepts.

I've used Sketch to draw all the scenarios and characters as vector images and animated the views using iOS.
