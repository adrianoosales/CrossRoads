# CrossRoads
WWDC 18 Scholarship Submission by Adriano Sales.

The WWDC 18 Scholarship Contest was aimed to create a PlaygroundBook. 

CrossRoads is a PlaygroundBook developed to introduce kids to the common structues in programming languages (functions, if-else, for and while, for example) and at the same time remember them the valuable and important teaching which every single parent or someone responsible for a kid try to teach. Concepts like brush the teeth, respect the older people and don't talk to strangers are some of them.
