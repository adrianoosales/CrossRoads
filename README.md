# CrossRoads
CrossRoads is a PlaygroundBook developed to introduce people to the common structues in programming languages. Concepts like functions, if-else statements, for and while loops are explained in a interactive and fun way. 

Our main character, Peter, is a clever boy and his parents are all the time trying to teach him important lessons. Things like brush your teeth, respect people older than you and don't talk to strangers are some of the lessons we will learn while trying to help Peter to take some decisions. 
For example, in one of the chapters we present a scene where it is raining outside. We should choose an action that Peter will take using the while loop. In this case, it's presented something like:  while it's raining, what should Peter do? 
If we choose to go outside anyway, Peter will get sick and he'll need to stay at home longer, until he is completely healed. Otherwise, if we choose to wait for the rain to stop, we can see that after the rain Peter is really happy playing outside all day long. 

This is a way to help kids to learn important lessons and at the same time we aim to introduce them to some fundamental programming language concepts.
